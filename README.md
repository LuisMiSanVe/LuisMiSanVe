## ðŸ“š Projects
Iâ€™m uploading interesting projects I develop at work (after removing all sensitive data). Hereâ€™s a sneak peek of some things Iâ€™m working on:
- .Net REST API with OAuth 2.0:\
  A secure API that requires users to log in to access endpoints using JWT Bearer Tokens, which are validated with OAuth 2.0.

- .Net-PHP REST API:\
  To prevent direct database access by users, this C# REST API communicates with a PHP REST API that handles all database interactions.

- Java Android App that updates itself:\
  An auxiliary app that, when added to another app, is capable of updating it automatically in the most efficient way possible.
