Iâ€™m uploading interesting projects I develop at work, along with other personal projects I've created. Hereâ€™s a sneak peek of some things Iâ€™m working on:

- [C# REST API with OAuth 2.0:](https://github.com/LuisMiSanVe/OAuth_API/tree/main)\
  A secure API that requires users to log in to access endpoints using JWT Bearer Tokens, which are validated with OAuth 2.0.

- [C#-PHP REST API:](https://github.com/LuisMiSanVe/CSharpPHP_API)\
  To prevent direct database access by users, this C# REST API communicates with a PHP REST API that handles all database interactions.

- [Java Android App that updates itself:](https://github.com/LuisMiSanVe/AutoUpdaterAndroid)\
  An auxiliary app that, when added to another app, is capable of updating it automatically in the most efficient way possible.
