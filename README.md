Iâ€™m uploading interesting projects I develop at work (after removing all sensitive data). Hereâ€™s a sneak peek of some things Iâ€™m working on:
- .Net REST API with OAuth 2.0:\
  An secure API that requires to log-in to access endpoints using JWT Bearer Tokens which are validated with OAuth 2.0.

- .Net-PHP REST API:\
  In order to avoid the user to act directly on the databases, this C# REST API communicates with an PHP REST API, which does all the actions with the database.

- Java Android App that updates itself:\
  Auxiliar App capable of updating another apps in the most automatic way possible.
